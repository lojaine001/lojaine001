## What I'm About

5th year AI Engineering student. I build machine learning systems and deploy them to production. Currently doing a dual degree program because apparently one wasn't enough.

Right now I'm deep into **computer vision**, **time series forecasting**, and figuring out how to make ML models not suck in production.

---

## 🛠️ What I Actually Use

**Day-to-day stack:**
```python
languages = ["Python", "JavaScript/TypeScript", "Java", "C++"]
ml_tools = ["PyTorch", "TensorFlow", "Scikit-learn", "OpenCV"]
deploy = ["FastAPI", "Docker", "GCP", "AWS"]
web = ["React", "Node.js"]
```

**When I need to:**
- Train deep learning models → PyTorch + GPU clusters
- Build APIs → FastAPI + Docker
- Work with images → OpenCV + albumentations
- Deploy to cloud → GCP/AWS + Docker
- Prototype quickly → Jupyter + Streamlit

## 🚀 Stuff I've Built

### Deep Learning for Tire Recognition
*Summer 2024 | Remote Internship*

Built a production-ready tire pattern recognition system. The interesting part? Making it work with limited data.

- Trained & compared **5 different architectures** (EfficientNet, ResNet, ConvNeXt, ViT, custom CNN)
- Engineered an augmentation pipeline that actually helped generalization
- Built REST API with FastAPI, Dockerized the whole thing
- **The challenge:** Small dataset, needed high accuracy for industrial use

**Tech:** PyTorch, FastAPI, Docker, OpenCV, Albumentations

### Bank Fraud Detection System
*Team project - 284K transactions*

Led a 3-person team building ML fraud detection for Moroccan banking sector. Real messy data, heavy class imbalance.

- Processed **284,807 transactions** - lots of data cleaning
- Tested multiple classifiers (RF, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)
- Used stratified k-fold because the data was super imbalanced
- Cut false positives by 23% vs baseline

**The lesson:** Imbalanced data is a pain. Feature engineering > fancy models.

**Tech:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn

### Weather Forecasting with LSTM
*Solo project*

Built an LSTM model for 7-day weather prediction. Hit **87% accuracy** which isn't bad for weather.

- Processed 2 years of multi-source weather data
- Engineered temporal features + seasonal patterns
- Built interactive dashboard for results

**The lesson:** Time series data needs domain knowledge, not just fancy architectures.

**Tech:** TensorFlow, LSTM, Time Series Analysis, Matplotlib

### Smart Home IoT System
*Hardware + Software*

Designed a home automation system with **15+ sensors/actuators**. Actually deployed in my apartment.

- Built with Arduino + ESP32 for hardware
- React dashboard for monitoring + control
- Automated logic based on environmental conditions
- **Real result:** 30% reduction in energy consumption

**The fun part:** When your code controls real-world devices and you realize bugs have consequences 😅

**Tech:** Arduino, C++, ESP32, React, Node.js

<sub>**Note to recruiters:** Yes, I can do more than just train models. I can deploy them, monitor them, and debug them when they inevitably break at 3 AM.</sub>
